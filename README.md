# JavaScript Hello World Programs

Welcome to the JavaScript Hello World Programs repository! Below, you'll find three simple JavaScript programs that greet the user based on their input. Each program demonstrates a different approach to user input handling and greeting display.

## Initial Guide to JavaScript Objects

### 1. Introduction to Objects:
   - In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a string (also known as a property) and each value can be of any data type (including other objects, arrays, functions, etc.).
   - Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning properties can be added or removed at runtime.

### 2. Creating Objects:
   - There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:
     - Object literals: `{}` notation.
     - Constructor functions: `function ObjectName() {}`.
     - ES6 Classes: `class ClassName {}`.
     - Object.create() method.
   
### 3. Accessing Object Properties:
   - Properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., `objectName.propertyName`) or bracket notation (e.g., `objectName['propertyName']`).
   - Bracket notation is useful when property names contain special characters, start with a number, or are dynamic.

### 4. Adding and Modifying Properties:
   - Properties can be added to an object simply by assigning a value to a new key.
   - Existing properties can be modified by assigning a new value to an existing key.

### 5. Removing Properties:
   - Properties can be removed from an object using the `delete` operator.

### 6. Object Methods:
   - Methods are functions stored as object properties.
   - They can be defined using regular function syntax or ES6 shorthand method syntax.

### 7. Object Iteration:
   - Objects can be iterated using various methods:
     - `for...in` loop: Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
     - `Object.keys()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.
     - `Object.values()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.
     - `Object.entries()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs.

### 8. Object Prototypes and Inheritance:
   - In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
   - Every JavaScript object has a prototype property, which points to the prototype object from which it inherits properties.

### 9. Object Serialisation:
   - Serialisation is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted.
   - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for serialising JavaScript objects.

### 10. Object Destructuring:
    - Object destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables in a single line of code.

### 11. Object Cloning:
    - Objects can be cloned using various methods, such as the spread operator (`{ ...obj }`), `Object.assign()`, or `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`.

### 12. Built-in Objects:
    - JavaScript provides several built-in objects that serve different purposes, such as `Math`, `Date`, `Array`, `String`, `RegExp`, etc.

## Programs

### Program 1: Hello World with Input using Classes

This program utilises a class structure to handle user input and display a personalised greeting.

### Program 3: Hello World with Input using Algorithm

This program handles user input and greeting display using an algorithmic approach.
