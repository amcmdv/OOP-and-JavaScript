# JavaScript Hello World Programs

Welcome to the JavaScript Hello World Programs repository! Below, you'll find three simple JavaScript programs that greet the user based on their input. Each program demonstrates a different approach to user input handling and greeting display.

# Quick JavaScript Refresher

This serves as a quick refresher on essential JavaScript concepts Let's dive in:

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects," which encapsulate data and behavior. OOP allows for the creation of reusable code and provides a way to structure and organise complex systems.

## Local & Global Variables

Local variables are declared within a function and can only be accessed within that function scope. Global variables, on the other hand, are declared outside of any function and can be accessed anywhere within the script. It's important to manage variable scope to avoid conflicts and maintain code clarity.

## The Various Loops

Loops are essential for repetitive tasks in programming. JavaScript offers various loop constructs:
- `for` loop: Executes a block of code a specified number of times.
- `while` loop: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
- `do...while` loop: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.
- `for...in` loop: Iterates over the properties of an object.
- `for...of` loop: Iterates over iterable objects such as arrays.

## If Statements

If statements are used for decision-making in code. They evaluate a condition and execute a block of code if the condition is true. If statements can include `else` and `else if` clauses to handle alternate conditions, making them versatile tools for controlling program flow.

## Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They accept inputs, process data, and return results. Functions play a crucial role in organising code and promoting code reusability. JavaScript functions can be declared using the `function` keyword and can accept parameters.

## Classes

Classes are blueprints for creating objects with predefined properties and methods. They facilitate the creation of objects with consistent structure and behavior, promoting code modularity and maintainability. JavaScript classes are introduced in ES6 and provide a way to define object-oriented structures in a more intuitive manner.

## Initial Guide to JavaScript Objects

### 1. Introduction to Objects:
   - In JavaScript, an object is a collection of key-value pairs where each key is a string (also known as a property) and each value can be of any data type (including other objects, arrays, functions, etc.).
   - Objects in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning properties can be added or removed at runtime.

### 2. Creating Objects:
   - There are several ways to create objects in JavaScript:
     - Object literals: `{}` notation.
     - Constructor functions: `function ObjectName() {}`.
     - ES6 Classes: `class ClassName {}`.
     - Object.create() method.
   
### 3. Accessing Object Properties:
   - Properties of an object can be accessed using dot notation (e.g., `objectName.propertyName`) or bracket notation (e.g., `objectName['propertyName']`).
   - Bracket notation is useful when property names contain special characters, start with a number, or are dynamic.

### 4. Adding and Modifying Properties:
   - Properties can be added to an object simply by assigning a value to a new key.
   - Existing properties can be modified by assigning a new value to an existing key.

### 5. Removing Properties:
   - Properties can be removed from an object using the `delete` operator.

### 6. Object Methods:
   - Methods are functions stored as object properties.
   - They can be defined using regular function syntax or ES6 shorthand method syntax.

### 7. Object Iteration:
   - Objects can be iterated using various methods:
     - `for...in` loop: Iterates over the enumerable properties of an object.
     - `Object.keys()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property names.
     - `Object.values()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property values.
     - `Object.entries()`: Returns an array of a given object's own enumerable property `[key, value]` pairs.

### 8. Object Prototypes and Inheritance:
   - In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from a prototype.
   - Every JavaScript object has a prototype property, which points to the prototype object from which it inherits properties.

### 9. Object Serialisation:
   - Serialisation is the process of converting an object into a format that can be stored or transmitted.
   - JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a popular format for serialising JavaScript objects.

### 10. Object Destructuring:
    - Object destructuring allows you to extract properties from an object and assign them to variables in a single line of code.

### 11. Object Cloning:
    - Objects can be cloned using various methods, such as the spread operator (`{ ...obj }`), `Object.assign()`, or `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))`.

### 12. Built-in Objects:
    - JavaScript provides several built-in objects that serve different purposes, such as `Math`, `Date`, `Array`, `String`, `RegExp`, etc.
